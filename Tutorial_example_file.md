  This is the abstract.

  It consists of two paragraphs. And it does not say much about the document.

# Title 1

## Title 2

### Title 3

A paragraph with *italic*.

Another one with **bold**.

And some ~~cancelled text~~.

And one with a link: [Wikipedia](http://www.wikipedia.org)

Or a link to a file on this repository: [more specific doc](./Tutorial_example_folder/Tutorial_example_subfile.md)

A list:

- some thing;
- an other thing.

An enumeration:

1. the first thing;
2. the second one

A more complex list

1. First thing
  - hello;
  - world

    This is just saying hello.
    
2. Second thing:
  - how do you do?
  - where is the coffee?
  
    This is typical conference morning behaviour.

3. Third thing:
  - this list is long enough.
  - don't you think?
    1. probably
    

Some code:

```xml
<hello>World</hello>
```

```python
import condorcet
for i in workshop.days():
    tutorial.write()

```

Some inline code: `print("Hello world")`

A table

N  | Time | Coffee
---|------|-------
1  | 10h  | 2
10 | 12h  | 8
1  |  9h  | 3

The same, in an easier to write, harder to read, fashion:

N|Time|Coffee
---|---|---
1|10h|2
10|12h|8
1|9h|3

A quotation:

> Rollant a dit: gloton desmesurez! Mar fustes vos nez !
> et neant plus bel ne lui volt dire.
